    <p>My name is Hayden Roworth... this is me and my friend Lex.
        <br>Student Number: s3856099
        <br>haydenroworth@hotmail.com
        <br>I'm a 24 year old from Newcastle Australia.
        <br> I currently worrk for Allianz Australia
        <br>I know alot...if not too much about the Simpsons. I can usually identify an episode within the first 30 seconds
    </p>
    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p> My interests have always resolved around how computers talk to one another.
        <br>How networks work & their inferstructure amazes me and I would like to eventually
        <br>go into that field. I chose RMIT as it would be able to fit in with my full time
        <br>employment & suit my life style as it is an online course. In terms of gain from this
        <br>I would like to have comfortable knowledge of the broad aspects of information technology.
        <br>I haven't had much exposure to the web development side, so as I'm writing this it is making
        <br>me appreciate this course alot more.
    </p>
    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <p>My dream or ideal job: <a href='https://www.seek.com.au/job/41153311?type=standard#searchRequestToken=2e65d6c4-5fad-4098-914b-d47849b89144'>Network Administrator</a></p>
    <br>The role of a network administrator makes you responsible for maintenance of a specific
    <br>computer network as well as solving any problems that occur with them.
    <br>This appeals to me because I enjoy being hands on as well as helping people. Being on the ground
    <br>essentially & trouble shooting makes it appealing as every day could be different administrator
    <br>and filled with different challenges.
    <br>
    <br>Qualifications for this role genually require a degree in network administration as well
    <br>as systems administration training. Effective communication skills are key as well as the
    <br>ability to demonstrate effective problem solving.
    <br>
    <br>I currently have a basic understanding of the following:
    <br>- Setting up a network with multiple PCs, enabling sharing, printing etc
    <br>- Ability to troubleshoot a number of networking issues
    <br>
    <br>I hope to obtain the relevant skills required for this positon thoughout the course
    <br>of this course. Ideally, after the basics are learnt I would like to tailor
    <br>my courses toward this position, ideally focusing on networking/cloud subjects
    <br>to assist in growing my knowledge and exposure.

    <br>Extravert(12%) Sensing(3%) Thinking(28%) Judging(3%)
    <br>You have slight preference of Extraversion over Introversion (12%)
    <br>You have marginal or no preference of Sensing over Intuition (3%)
    <br>You have moderate preference of Thinking over Feeling (28%)
    <br>You have marginal or no preference of Judging over Perceiving (3%)
    <br>
    <br><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b> Allows me to now take a step back and analyse myself moving forward. Especially in relation to my judgemental trait and the use of feelings over thoughts. They have highlighted areas that
    would need to be self-managed in a team environment which now can be used to my advantage from here on.
    <br>
    <br><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b> Some aspects of myself would have to change in order to ensure the team can perform. Potentially utilising these to my advantage, especially assertiveness as it will
    assist in driving the team forward.
    <br>
    <br><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b> Look at specific traits that could impact the ability to work constructively in a team. Learn to manage those and be mindful of other people’s traits and the potential of personality
    clashing.



    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Mobile App – Pick My Dinner</h3>

    <br><b> Overview: </b>
    <br> Pick My Dinner will allow the user to simply press a button and the app generates a meal at random. When a user first downloads the app, there will be a selection of food categories you can select as preferences. Utilising that information each
    time you press the button to retrieve a meal, it will select at random a meal from one of those categories. Therefore, the sometimes-painful process of picking dinner is solved!
    <br>

    <br><b> Motivation: </b>
    <br>Easily 5 out of 7 nights at my house dinner is decided on the day and is a lengthy process. Having something like this takes the uncertainty away and gives you an answer and if you’re not happy just press the button until something appealing makes
    its way onto the screen. As well as eliminating the guess work, sometimes I find that the same selection of meals keeps coming up and it could be time for something new, with 100s to 1000s of meal ideas, ideally it should take some time to eat the
    same thing twice.
    <br>
    <br><b> Description: </b>
    <br>Features: Selection of preferred categories/cuisines, ability to favourite a meal The app needs to be as simple and user friendly as possible. Opening initially to a single page that displays all available categories for the user to select and
    save. Making this feature changeable is paramount as you may need to cater for another person’s dietary requirements. As an example: You need to deselect sea food as you’re hosting guests that are allergic. Once the initial section has been complete,
    the main home screen would show the following two options. “Pick My Dinner” or “Dinner with others”. The favouring of meal feature will allow the app to store items as favourites which will circulate in the normal pool of meals but if the user hasn’t
    decided after 20 randomly generated choices it will show a favourite. In terms of recipes, initially the application would just display meals & based on popularity or demand, the potential to partner with a service that offers online recipes. Or simply
    suggest to the user to search online: Example: Just search “Beef Tacos recipe”
    <br>

    <br><b> Tools and Technologies:: </b>
    <br> Utilising a MySQL database or similar database technology to store the data required, for this instance it would be the users selections of categories and favourites. You would need an API to interface between the app on the device and the cloud
    hosted MySQL storage & a cloud hosting platform to cater for the above two requirements (hosting of a lightweight javascript API and MySQL server). The MIT app inventor would be a great beginner tool as it is simplistic and user friendly.
    <br>
    <br><b>Skills Required:</b>
    <br>The skills required would be a working knowledge of the above mentioned technologies, have the ability to design appropriately and make the user interface appealing.
    <br>If the developer was to design from scratch and not utilise an app building tool you would need the app to be cross platform compatible.
    <br>
    <br><b>Outcome:</b> Simply eliminating the guess work for the user. Allowing them to still have some power by having the ability
    <br>to continue to request meals and then obtain a recipe if required I think will maintain engaement. The user
    <br>hasn’t completely given up on the decision they're just assisted with their preference.
